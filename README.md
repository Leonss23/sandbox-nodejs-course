# sandbox-nodejs-course
Sandbox where I practice while following along nodejs courses.


Note: Abandoned it, instead of following along tutorials/courses, I decided to start a small project (fullstack to-do app) boarding most concepts and technologies I want to learn, and figure it out along the way using whatever resource results useful.
